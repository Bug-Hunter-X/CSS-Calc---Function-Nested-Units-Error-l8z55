The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error involving the `calc()` function and nested units:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  height: calc(calc(100% - 20px) * 2);
}
```

The inner `calc()` function attempts to perform multiplication on a value with a unit ( `100% - 20px` which results in a mixed unit value).  This is not directly supported by all browsers, leading to unexpected results or errors.  Older browsers might fail to render the element correctly.
