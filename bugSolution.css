The solution involves restructuring the calculation to avoid mixing units within a single `calc()` operation:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
  height: calc(100% - 20px * 2);
  /* or */
  height: calc(100% - 40px);
}
```

By separating the calculation into simpler steps or using consistent units, we prevent the mixed-unit error.  Always ensure calculations within `calc()` use compatible units to avoid unexpected behavior across different browsers.
